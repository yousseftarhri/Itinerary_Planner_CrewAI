# 🧠 Smart Itinerary Planner with AI Agents using CrewAI

This project is a smart itinerary planner built with [CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI), an open-source Python framework that orchestrates AI agents to collaborate on tasks.

Simply enter the **city** you're traveling to and your **hobbies**, and the AI agents will work together to generate a personalized **7-day itinerary** for your destination.

## 🚀 How It Works

The project is powered by multiple specialized AI agents, each responsible for a specific role:

- 🗺️ **Tourism Guide**: Suggests the top places to visit in the city.
- 🧗 **Activities Guide**: Recommends fun and engaging activities.
- 🍽️ **Food Recommender**: Lists the must-try local dishes and food spots.
- 🧳 **Travel Planner**: Combines everything into a clear and structured 7-day itinerary.

CrewAI coordinates these agents to collaborate **sequentially** and produce the final output.
